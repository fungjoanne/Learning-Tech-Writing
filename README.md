## Steps to making and pushing changes
1. `git branch`: Create new branch to make changes
2. `git checkout branch`: Brings you to the branch that you list

    *Note: Use `git checkout -b branchname` to create new branch and check it out at the same time*
3. Save changes made
4. `git add .`: Stages changes 
5. `git commit -m "message"`: Commits changes
6. `git push origin branchname`: Pushes changes to the GitHub repo 

## Other Git commands
- `git pull`: Pulls all changes from GitHub down to the local clone

## Terms
- Local: personal computer folders
